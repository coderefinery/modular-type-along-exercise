# modular-type-along-exercise

This repository is used for an optional exercise/"home work"
during the lesson
[Modular code development - Making reusing parts of your code easier](https://coderefinery.github.io/modular-type-along/).

## Environment setup

To run the notebook, you'll need the same conda environment used throughout this workshop. You can activate it and launch Jupyter Lab with these commands:
```bash
   conda activate coderefinery
   jupyter lab
```
